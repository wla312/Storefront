# Storefront
Inventory tracking using Node.js and MySQL

##Introduction
-----------------
This project is an Amazon-inspired storefront application built using node.js and MySQL.

### Customer View:
Running file [bamazonCustomer.js] in node allows customers to view and select inventory to purchase.

All inventory is held in the 'products' table of a MySQL database called 'bamazon'. Refer to [bamazonSeeds.sql] to build your own database to replicate this project.

For a walkthrough of user functionality, refer to the [video][ ].
